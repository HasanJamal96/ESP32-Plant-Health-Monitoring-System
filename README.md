# ESP32-Plant-Health-Monitoring-System

Two buttons are used in this project

  1 is to calibrate LUX sensor for chlorophyll index
  2 is to take measurements of chlorophyll index in plants


OLED 128x64 0.96 is used to display different sensors values like:
  Soil mointure (FC-28)
  Humidity & Temperautre (HDC1080)
  Lux Sensor for chlorophyll index (TSL2591)
  LDR for outside light intensity
